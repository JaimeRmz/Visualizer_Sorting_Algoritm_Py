Vizualizer Sorting Algorithm by Jaime Ramirez   

This Python script utilizes the Pygame library to visually demonstrate two sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. It initializes a Pygame window and defines constants and functions for drawing and interacting with the visualization. The sorting algorithms, Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort, are implemented as generator functions, allowing for step-by-step visualization updates. The main loop manages user input for starting, resetting, and changing sorting algorithms and order. Users can control the sorting process, toggle between ascending and descending order, and select the sorting algorithm to visualize. The visualization comprises bars representing elements in a list, with colors indicating their position and sorting progress. As the sorting algorithms execute, the Pygame window updates dynamically to reflect the current state of the list and the progress of the sorting algorithm. Overall, the script provides an interactive platform for users to observe and comprehend the functionality of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort through visual representation.
